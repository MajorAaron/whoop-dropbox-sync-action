# Setup Automatic Token Updates

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create Personal Access Token (PAT)
Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

Settings:
- **Name**: Whoop Token Updater
- **Expiration**: 90 days or more
- **Scope**: âœ… `repo` (full control)
- Click "Generate token"
- **COPY THE TOKEN!**

### 2. Add PAT to Your Repository
```bash
# Run this script and paste your PAT when prompted:
./add-pat-token.sh
```

### 3. Add Workflow to THE-MAINFRAME Repository

Go to your THE-MAINFRAME repository and create this file:
`.github/workflows/whoop-sync.yml`

Copy the contents from: `auto-update-workflow.yml`

Or run these commands:
```bash
# Navigate to your THE-MAINFRAME repo
cd ~/path/to/THE-MAINFRAME

# Create workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy the workflow
cp ~/Sites/whoop-obsidian-sync-action/auto-update-workflow.yml .github/workflows/whoop-sync.yml

# Commit and push
git add .github/workflows/whoop-sync.yml
git commit -m "Add Whoop sync workflow with automatic token updates"
git push
```

### 4. Test It!
Go to: https://github.com/MajorAaron/THE-MAINFRAME/actions

Click on "Sync Whoop Data to Obsidian" â†’ "Run workflow"

## How It Works

The workflow will:
1. âœ… Run daily at 6:15 AM (or manually)
2. âœ… Sync your Whoop data to Obsidian notes
3. âœ… Automatically update the refresh token if it rotates
4. âœ… Commit the changes to your repository
5. âœ… No manual token updates needed!

## Verify It's Working

After the first run, check:
1. Your WHOOP folder has new markdown files
2. The Actions tab shows "âœ… Sync Whoop Data to Obsidian"
3. If token rotated, you'll see "ðŸ”„ Token Rotated: Refresh token was automatically updated" in the summary

## Troubleshooting

If token update fails:
- Make sure PA_TOKEN secret is set correctly
- Ensure the PAT has `repo` scope
- Check the workflow has `secrets: write` permission

## Security Notes

- The PAT is only used to update the refresh token secret
- Delete `add-pat-token.sh` after use
- Rotate your PAT every 90 days for security
